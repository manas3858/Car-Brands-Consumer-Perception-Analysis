The aim of this project is to analyze customer perception about leading US car brands.

### Approach
This project followed the following approach:
  1. Scraped ~6k reviews using Selenium to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums
  2. Clean the data using NLTK
  3. Find association between top 10 brands calculation lift ratios
  4. Visualize the brands on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map
  5. Understand the key attributes of top brands
  6. Find the most aspirational brands
  7. Give recommendation to Brand Managers and Marketing Teams

### Insights
Based on the analysis, here are some of the key insights:

**Acura** passes off among the public as a forgotten luxury car, with higher quality and associated highest with reliability. However, the lift calculations show that Acura drops off at a bad rate here. The lift rate shows that Acura fails here to be qualified as a good performer. Close to the other luxury brands, that is, Mercedes and Infiniti in the MDS chart, the differentiating factor is Acura’s age-old branding as a reliable machine. If the brand captures this back and gets rid of the growing concern over Acura’s performance and reliability, the brand can reinvent itself and get back into the race.

**Infiniti** fares high in the power part, competing well in the other sectors with it’s closest competitor according to MDS, Acura. Thus using the power factor as its branding and aiming audience who wish for a powerful car, it can gain advantage over Acura.

**Toyota is the most desired brand** closely followed by Lexus and Mercedes since it has considerably high lift with aspirational words when compared to other brands. Having observed that Toyota has a high lift with realiability, imply that entry level luxury car prospected buyers are considering realiabilty as top attribute for their decision.
