The aim of this project is to analyze customer perception about leading US car brands.

This project followed the following approach:
  1. Scraped ~6k reviews using Selenium to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums
  2. Clean the data using NLTK
  3. Find association between top 10 brands calculation lift ratios
  4. Visualize the brands on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map
  5. Understand the key attributes of top brands
  6. Find the most aspirational brands
  7. Give recommendation to Brand Managers and Marketing Teams
  
Insights to Product Manager

1. BMW: Though BMW claims they are ‘The Ultimate Driving Machine’, the lift calculations between BMW and performance shows otherwise. Upon considering transmission and power, BMW does not score well either. BMW should improve the performance factor to match what their tagline says, according to general public opinion on Edmunds forum
2. Acura: Acura passes off among the public as a forgotten luxury car, with higher quality and associated highest with reliability. However, the lift calculations show that Acura drops off at a bad rate here. The lift rate shows that Acura fails here to be qualified as a good performer. Close to the other luxury brands, that is, Mercedes and Infiniti in the MDS chart, the differentiating factor is Acura’s age-old branding as a reliable machine. If the brand captures this back and gets rid of the growing concern over Acura’s performance and reliability, the brand can reinvent itself and get back into the race
3. Infiniti: Infiniti, another luxury brand, lies close to Acura in the MDS graph. It fails in the performance sector. While aiming for luxury, a notch better performance would help Infiniti gain a better leverage over the other above-mentioned brands. However, it has an edge over Acura in the pricing aspect.
4. Lexus: The name Lexus itself is synonymous to luxury and dependability. In fact, Lexus has won ‘The Most Dependable Luxury brand of 2019’ - eight time in a row. This tells us that the general public do correlate Lexus not only as a luxury brand, pleasing to the eye and aesthetically rich, but also as a highly reliable car. Looking at the lift calculations show us that Lexus is less called of with price related things, which may indicate that people don't talk about Lexus's price much, a positive sign for the brand
5. Mercedes: Mercedes, another luxury brand, fails at capturing positive ratings in the performance sector. Gaining good points in the price and transmission feature, it looses edge in the reliability feature. If Mercedes can pull up its reliability , it can race ahead in the luxury beast sector.
